# SPWLA Workshop on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (12th - 13th May 2021)

**Instructors:** Lalitha Venkataramanan (SLB), Chicheng Xu (Aramco), Andy McDonald (LR), Vikas Jain (SLB)


### About the Course

This workshop will focus on the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to the upstream O&G industry. Consisting of two half-days, the workshop will provide an introduction to machine learning, lay out sample workflows and steps for ML applications and summarize some of the used cases in the industry.

The workshop will cover both supervised and unsupervised learning and highlight applications such as QA/QC, outlier detection, facies mapping and learning complex functional mapping.

Hands-on tutorials with Python codes to analyze a publicly available data set will also be provided.

She is regional distinguished speaker for SPWLA for 2018-19. She is on the board of SIAM and NSERC as well as Business-Industry-Government Math network. Her current interests include machine learning, mathematical modeling and inversion, optimization, probability and stochastic processes. Trained as an Electrical Engineer, she obtained her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University in 1998. She has co-authored 40+ peer-reviewed publications and has over 24 granted US patents and 18 pending patent applications.

**Dr. Chicheng Xu** is currently working in Aramco Houston Research Center as a research petrophysicist with a focus area in Petrophysics Data-Driven Analytics that utilizes advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence/machine learning for interpretation, classification, and modeling based on multi-scale data integration. He obtained his PhD degree in petroleum engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2013 and had previously worked in various technology departments of Schlumberger, BP, and BHP Billiton. He was selected to receive the SPE Gulf Coast Regional Formation Evaluation Award in 2018 and the outstanding Associate Editor service award of SPE REE journal in 2020.

**Andy McDonald** is a Petrophysicist and has been with Lloyd’s Register for 9 years. He provides petrophysical expertise to software development projects, has a strong interest in Python programming and applications of Machine Learning to the geoscience domain. He holds an MSc in Earth Science and a BSc (Hons) in Geology & Petroleum Geology. Andy has co-authored several technical papers for SPWLA and SPE conferences covering machine learning, heavy oil, and low salinity waterflooding.

**Vikas Jain** is currently working in Schlumberger’s Analysis and Interpretation business as Principal Petrophysicist and Global Domain Head of Petrophysics and Acoustics, based out of Houston, U.S.A. His focal area is development of custom and intelligent solutions, leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence, to help solve common upstream challenges. Previously he was managing Interpretation Engineering projects of NMR Answer Products and Next Generation Data-Driven Petrophysics in Schlumberger’s Engineering Center in Houston. He started his career with Schlumberger in 2001 as a field engineer. Since then, he has held positions in operations, sales, marketing, domain and engineering. He has authored more than 35 publications and 15 patent applications/grants.
